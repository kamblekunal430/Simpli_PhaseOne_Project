                Simplilearn, a global leader in digital skills training, today
                announced the milestone of 2 million learners onboarded across
                the platform. The company which began operations in 2010
                achieved the 1 million mark in early 2018 and has now doubled
                this count in under 3 years. <br />
                Every month, nearly 70,000 learners actively train on the
                platform, akin to a large university campus with an equal number
                of students studying at campus. This growth has been accelerated
                with the onset of the pandemic, which has forced professionals
                to best utilize their time by upskilling and learning online to
                succeed in their careers. Simplilearn's high-touch learning,
                bootcamp-style learning model, hands-on projects, and
                partnerships with leading global universities and corporates
                stand as strong pillars to make it the upskilling partner of
                choice for individuals and corporations across the globe. <br />
                Simplilearn's certification courses are developed with industry
                partners like Microsoft, AWS, IBM, and Facebook. The company
                currently offers 15 Post Graduate Programs in collaboration with
                leading institutions of higher education like Purdue University,
                Caltech Center for Technology and Management Education, and
                UMass Amherst in skills including data science, artificial
                intelligence, DevOps, full stack development, project
                management, and digital marketing. In 2020, Simplilearn
                introduced a free skills development program called SkillUp.
                This program offers over 1,000 hours of self-paced video
                learning in 300 digital skills, and allows learners to explore
                in-demand topics in top professional and technology fields for
                free - helping them make the right learning and career
                decisions. While the majority of the learner base consists of
                individual B2C learners, the company offers outcome-driven
                corporate training and upskilling programs for organizations
                across 12 countries today. Simplilearn offers aspirants both
                short term and Master's programs in digital skills and new-age
                technologies. Simplilearn bootcamp approach to training not only
                focuses on offering a real classroom experience to its learners
                but also provides the opportunity to get job-ready training
                through hands-on labs in the skills and tools that are in top
                demand today. All this is made possible through Simplilearn's AI
                powered learning platform, 'EngageX', that successfully delivers
                high engagement rates and a unique learning experience to the
                learners. Krishna Kumar, Founder & CEO, Simplilearn, said, "2020
                brought to the forefront a new wave of digital transformation,
                making digital economy skills vital for the foundation of a
                successful career and long-run competitiveness. With upskilling
                and reskilling key to future growth opportunities, online
                learning has gained popularity among both students and
                professionals. Adding to this was the work-from-home scenario,
                and uncertainties in the job sector post the pandemic which
                encouraged many professionals to invest in self-development. In
                fact, we saw a 60% jump in enrollments in the early days of
                lockdown. Over the last 6 months, we also on-boarded over 50,000
                corporate learners across 12 countries. We also saw several
                Indian startups and leading universities partner with us for
                tech-specific skilling programs." Simplilearn conducts more than
                1,500 live classes, with an average of 70,000 learners who
