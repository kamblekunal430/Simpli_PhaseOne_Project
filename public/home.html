                    Simplilearn Doubles Learner Count in Three Years, Now 2
                    Million Strong

                <p class="blog-brief">
                    Simplilearn, a global leader in digital skills training,
                    today announced the milestone of 2 million learners
                    onboarded across the platform. The company which began
                    operations in 2010 achieved the 1 million mark in early 2018
                    and has now doubled this count in under 3 years. Every
                    month, nearly 70,000 learners actively train on the
                    platform, akin to a large university campus with an equal
                    number of students studying at campus. This growth has been
                    accelerated with the onset of the pandemic, which has forced
                    professionals to best utilize their time by upskilling and
                    learning online to succeed in their careers.

                    The digital transformation wave is sweeping across the IT

                    organizational culture and upgrade the skills of their
                    workforce that will help them implement digital technologies
