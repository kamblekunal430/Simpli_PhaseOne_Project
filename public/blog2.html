                businesses and consumers taking to online platforms more rapidly
                than before, digital marketing is today an essential growth tool
                for brands and larger organisations. That said, the demand for
                digital marketers is at its peak, making it one of the top jobs
                for 2021. The Digital Marketing program is designed for learners
                to gain an understanding of data collection and analysis methods
                used by marketing professionals, and learn to access, choose and

                given marketing budget. This program caters to those looking for
                a new career in digital marketing or who want to improve their
                marketability to potential employers. We are happy to

                public universities and provide our learners with an online

                that with half the world's population using social media,
                companies are making significant investments in digital media
                marketing. By the end of 2020, advertising spends on social
                networks are expected to reach more than 50 billion dollars.
                Every organization should understand why it has become essential
                to implement and upskill workforce in digital solutions. We look
