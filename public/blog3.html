                The digital transformation wave is sweeping across the IT
                industry in India. More than adopting the technology,
                enterprises are struggling to drive a change in the
                organizational culture and upgrade the skills of their workforce
                that will help them implement digital technologies at all stages
                of the business. IDC recently predicted that by 2020, 60 percent
                of all enterprises will have, fully articulated an
                organization-wide “digital platform strategy” and will be in the
                process of implementing that strategy. By the end of next year,
                digital transformation spending will reach $1.7 trillion
                worldwide, a 42 percent increase from 2017. Upskilling existing
                employees to be an enabler of digital transformation has been a
                challenge for enterprises across the globe. In order to address
                this situation, Simplilearn, leading professional online
                certification provider has launched Digital Transformation
                Academy – a complete suite of courses specially tailored for
                enterprise needs.

                <br />
                In an interview with ETCIO.COM, Krishna Kumar, Founder & CEO of
                Simplilearn discusses the rationale behind the strategic
                initiative and the ways in which it will bridge the skill gap
                The problem of skill drought has toppled enterprise security as
                the topmost challenge in the adoption of a digital enterprise.
                How is Simplilearn working towards bridging the skill gap?
                Increasing number of data breaches and security issues is a
                boardroom issue today and this has led to unfilled cybersecurity
                jobs worldwide. At Simplilearn, we are helping enterprises
                bridge the skill-gap by ensuring their employees are trained to
                spot vulnerabilities, fend off attacks, and respond to
                emergencies. We have partnered with domain experts and
                accredited bodies to ensure the courses are aligned with the
                industry requirements leading to certifications. What is the
                rationale behind the Simplilearn Digital Transformation Academy?
                Since our inception, Simplilearn’s mission has been to help

                What are the various areas in which Simplilearn Digital
                Transformation Academy will promote digital dexterity? Digital
                transformation is the process of “transforming” the mindset of
                an organization and implementing strategies that use digital
                technologies in all stages of business. The academy covers all
                aspects of people, process and technology to achieve competency
                in digital technologies including Design Thinking, Big Data,
                Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing
                and DevOps, Cyber Security, Programming and Automation, Digital
                Marketing and more. How will the skills be imparted and what are
                the costs involved? We will partner with enterprises in
                identifying the business areas where digital technologies can be
                leveraged. Focusing on our outcome-centric, high-engagement
                learning approach, employees can learn through a combination of
                flexible live online instructor-led virtual classroom and
                self-paced learning model. Each course is supplemented with
                applied learning projects and real-world case studies, with
                hands-on practice via Simplilearn’s CloudLab online development
                environment. With an intuitive learning management system (LMS),
                managers and team leads can track the progress of employees,
                with frequent reports and alerts that help ensure high course
                completions. How will the Simplilearn Digital Transformation
                Academy help the CIOs and their IT department? CIOs and IT
                leaders are the driving force behind innovation and adopting new
                technologies in any organization. It’s among their top
                priorities to ensure their teams are constantly equipped with
                relevant skills for a seamless digital transformation journey.

                strategy will help leaders to identify opportunities and correct
                skill deficits in new and emerging technologies
