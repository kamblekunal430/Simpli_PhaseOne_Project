                Mumbai, Jan 20 (PTI) Even as the evolution of the business
                landscape in 2020 led to changes in job requirements, a survey
                has showed that a majority of professionals (67.5 per cent) see
                learning as the key to get better opportunities, and also plan
                to start learning programmes this year. Last year saw the
                evolution of a changing business landscape, which in turn
                resulted in changes to job requirements prompting both working
                professionals and job seekers to invest in new skills, according
                to ed-tech firm Simplilearn''s annual report. The report, based
                on the survey, showed that professionals are taking a proactive
                approach to career success in 2021, and 67.5 per cent of those
                interviewed see learning as the key to landing better
                opportunities, and plan to start learning programmes this year.
                The survey interviewed over 5,000 Simplilearn learners,
                comprising both individual and corporate learners, of which 19.4
                per cent respondents were freshers, 51.3 per cent mid-level and
                29.2 per cent senior-level professionals. A majority of the
                respondents were from the information technology sector,
                followed by manufacturing, consulting and finance. Further, the
                survey showed that in 2020, 14 per cent of the respondents lost
                their jobs, 41 per cent of mid-career professionals felt
                stagnant in their careers and in large organisations, 25 per
                cent of professionals felt stuck. However, professionals are
                taking a proactive approach to career success in 2021, with 35
                per cent of respondents seeing the pandemic as an opportunity to
                learn new skills, it said. This number rose to 49.5 per cent of
                employees in small and medium enterprises, it added. About 4 per
                cent of respondents feel keeping their jobs depends on learning
                new skills, while 66 per cent of professionals are either
                enrolled in training programmes or plan to start this year, it
                stated. Simplilearn founder and CEO Krishna Kumar said, "The
                work-from-home scenario, which is a by-product of the effects of
                the pandemic and the new normal, has driven a clear trend to
                online learning. With individuals getting a little extra time
                for self-development, we saw a 60 per cent jump in enrolments in
                the early days of lockdown itself." He said the usage on the
                platform has doubled compared to pre-pandemic times. Another
                factor that contributed to this was career uncertainty and job
                losses which made it clear to many professionals that digital
                skills is key to career stability and growth, he said. PTI SM
